##Actual TODO:
* File transfer: Download, Rename, Move
* Better debugger integration
* Bug: Crash if EmuThread terminated and debugger command entered

##Wishlist:
* More translations
* Language selection at runtime ?
* Skin loader/switcher
* Embedded updater (checker/downloader/installer)
* Scripting support, somehow
* Expose the calc as a fake USB one
* Communication with USB peripherals over libusb
* Different "kits": Selectable sets of flash/boot1/settings
