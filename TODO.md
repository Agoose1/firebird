##TODO:
* Implement on Windows: COW flash loading
* Optimize x86_64 JIT: {read,write}_{byte,half,word} in asm
* File transfer: Download, Rename, Move
* Better debugger integration

##Wishlist:
* Language selection at runtime?
* Skin loader/switcher
* Embedded updater (checker/downloader/installer)
* Scripting support, somehow
* Expose the calc as a fake USB one
* Communication with USB peripherals over libusb
* Different "kits": Selectable sets of flash/boot1/settings
* Get the touchpad working in a way the OS's cursor likes
