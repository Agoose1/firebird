nspire_emu
==========

This project is currently the main TI-Nspire/CAS/Touchpad emulator.  
The original piece of software can be found in the "mirror" branch or in the original repository located at ~~https://www.unsads.com/scm/svn/nsptools/Ndless/trunk/Ndless-SDK/nspire_emu/~~. The new repo location is in 
Github https://github.com/OlivierA/Ndless.

Either new instructions about how to mirror will be made or a new common repo will be made after talking to them.
